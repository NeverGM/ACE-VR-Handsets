A full 2011 kit for ACE VR. These are parts intended for VR handsets and are not compatible with the real thing.

Includes handset, trigger, mag release, and sear. 


5" slide model is "fullsize_2011.stl"
4.25" slide model is "commander_2011.stl"


The trigger + sear combo will produce a defined wall and crisp break, initially breaking at 3.5 pounds, but lightening relatively quickly to 2 - 2.5 pounds after pulling the trigger multiple times.


I recommend printing the handset with 6 wall loops, 25% infill, and with fuzzy skin enabled (0.3mm x 0.3mm)

Print the sear lying flat on its side with the smallest layer height and highest quality your printer can manage, using 6 wall loops, 25% infill and fuzzy skin disabled.

The trigger and mag release should also be printed with 6 wall loops, 25% infill and fuzzy skin disabled, at whatever layer height you prefer.



Compliments to Competion Shooting Analytics for the original trigger model (which I've modified to fit my handset) and to Charles for the #1 Sear
