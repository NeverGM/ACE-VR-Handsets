A full 2011 kit for ACE VR. These are parts intended for VR handsets and are not compatible with the real thing.

Includes handset, trigger, mag release, lifter arm and sear. 




- 5" slide model is "fullsize_2011_V2.stl"

- 4.25" slide model is "commander_2011_V2.stl"




The trigger + lifter arm + sear combo will produce the shortest pretravel possible with a defined wall and crisp break, initially breaking at 3.5 pounds, but lightening relatively quickly to 2 - 2.5 pounds after pulling the trigger multiple times.



**All settings below assume you are using a 0.4mm nozzle and 0.20mm layer height**
- Orient the handset so either the magazine basepad or the top of the slide is flat on the build plate. Use tree supports (organic), and print with 6 wall loops, 50% sparse infill density (gyroid). If you want the grip area to have texture, use fuzzyskin_modifier.stl and set the fuzzy skin value of the modifier to 0.2mm distance x 0.5mm thickness

- Print the sear and lifter arm lying flat on their side with the smallest layer height and highest quality your printer can manage, using 100% sparse infill density, and fuzzy skin disabled.

- The trigger and mag release should also be printed with 100% sparse infill density, and fuzzy skin disabled, at whatever layer height you prefer.
