A full 2011 kit for ACE VR. These are parts intended for VR handsets and are not compatible with the real thing.

Includes handset, trigger, mag release, lifter arm and sear. 




- 5" slide model is "fullsize_2011_V2.stl"

- 4.25" slide model is "commander_2011_V2.stl"




The trigger + lifter arm + sear combo will produce the shortest pretravel possible with a defined wall and crisp break, initially breaking at 3.5 pounds, but lightening relatively quickly to 2.5 pounds after pulling the trigger multiple times.



**All settings below assume you are using PLA as your material and have a 0.4mm nozzle using 0.20mm layer height**
- Orient the model so the mag basepad is flat on the build plate. Use tree supports (organic), and print with 6 wall loops, 25% sparse infill density. If you want the grip area to have texture, use fuzzyskin_modifier.stl and set the fuzzy skin value of the modifier to 0.2mm distance x 0.5mm thickness

- Print the sear and lifter arm lying flat their its side with the smallest layer height and highest quality your printer can manage, using 6 wall loops, 25% sparse infill density, and fuzzy skin disabled.

- The trigger and mag release should also be printed with 6 wall loops, 25% sparse infill density, and fuzzy skin disabled, at whatever layer height you prefer.





Compliments to Competition Shooting Analytics for the original trigger model (which I've modified to fit my handset) and to Charles for the #1 Sear
