A full 2011 kit for ACE VR. These are parts intended for VR handsets and are not compatible with the real thing.

Includes handset, trigger, mag release, and sear. 




- 5" slide model is "fullsize_2011.stl"

- 4.25" slide model is "commander_2011.stl"




The trigger + sear combo will produce a defined wall and crisp break, initially breaking at 3.5 pounds, but lightening relatively quickly to 2.5 pounds after pulling the trigger multiple times.



**All settings below assume you are using PLA as your material and have a 0.4mm nozzle**
- Orient the model so the mag basepad is flat on the build plate. Use tree supports, and print with 6 wall loops, 25% spare infill density, and with fuzzy skin enabled and set to contour (0.3mm x 0.3mm)

- Print the sear lying flat on its side with the smallest layer height and highest quality your printer can manage, using 6 wall loops, 25% spare infill density, and fuzzy skin disabled.

- The trigger and mag release should also be printed with 6 wall loops, 25% spare infill density, and fuzzy skin disabled, at whatever layer height you prefer.





Compliments to Competition Shooting Analytics for the original trigger model (which I've modified to fit my handset) and to Charles for the #1 Sear
